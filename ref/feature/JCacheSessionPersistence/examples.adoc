=== Configure Liberty servers to persist session data with `JCache`

Following is an example to configure session persistence by using Hazelcast as the JCache provider:


[source,java]
----

  <library id="jCacheVendorLib">
    <fileset dir="${shared.resource.dir}/hazelcast" includes="hazelcast.jar"/>
  </library>

  <httpSessionCache libraryRef="jCacheVendorLib"
                    uri="file:${shared.resource.dir}/hazelcast/hazelcast.xml"/>

  <httpSession cloneId="${cloneId}"/>
----

The library element defines a library that points to the location of your JCache provider.
The JCache provider in this example is Hazelcast, which is located in a JAR file called hazelcast.jar in the Hazelcast installation directory(The location of the installation?).
A clone ID is xxxxx (what is it? or would that be obvious to someone configuring session caching?) and is unique for each server.
In the example, the clone ID is server1, which matches the clone ID shown in (where?). 
Additional Hazelcast configuration is provided in the hazelcast.xml file.
