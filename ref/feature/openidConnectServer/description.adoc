Single sign-on is a process to sign in once with your credentials to access multiple applications.
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a protocol that helps developers authenticate users without the need to manage user credentials.
You can configure Open Liberty as an SSO provider.
Users need one time authentication to access Open Liberty resources such as HTML, JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, and servlets.
Users can also access resources in multiple Open Liberty servers that share Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) keys with a single sign-on.
