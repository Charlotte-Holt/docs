Social login is a form of single sign-on (SSO) that enables users to sign in to a secured website by using their existing social media account instead of creating an account specifically for the website. For example, you can configure social login so that users can log in to your website with their Facebook or Twitter accounts. You can enable social login for any social media platform that uses the OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect 1.0 standard for authorization.
