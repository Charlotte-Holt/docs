== Examples

Open Liberty supports many common SPNEGO scenarios and configurations.

=== Limit SPNEGO authentication
You can filter HTTP requests to require SPNEGO authentication for only certain requests, web applications, hosts, or user agents.
This example configures the following points for SPNEGO authentication:

[source,xml]
----
<authFilter id="myAuthFilter">
          <host id="myHost" name="example.com" matchType="contains" /> <1>
          <webApp id="myWebApp" name="protectedApp" matchType="equals" /> <1>
</authFilter>

<spnego id="mySpnego"
        includeClientGSSCredentialInSubject="false" <2>
        krb5Config="${server.config.dir}/resources/security/kerberos/krb5.conf" <3>
        krb5Keytab="${server.config.dir}/resources/security/kerberos/krb5.keytab" <3>
        servicePrincipalNames="HTTP/myLibertyMachine.example.com"
        authFilterRef="myAuthFilter" />
</spnego>
----
<1> SPNEGO authentication is used for any requests received that contain the `example.com` hostname for resources within the `protectedApp` web application.
<2> The client's GSS credentials are not added to the user subject upon successful authentication.
<3> The Kerberos configuration and keytab files to be used by the server are given specific locations within the server configuration directory instead of their respective default locations.
