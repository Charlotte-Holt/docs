= Metrics reference list

This reference list includes all the metrics that are available for Open Liberty. Use metric data to effectively monitor the status of your microservice systems.

Metrics are emitted from a number of different places. You can obtain them from applications, the Open Liberty runtime, and the Java virtual machine (JVM). They can be gathered and stored in database tools, such as link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus], and displayed on dashboards, such as link:https://grafana.com/[Grafana]. For more information about building observability into your applications, see link:/docs/ref/general/#microservice_observability_metrics.html[Microservice observability with metrics].
