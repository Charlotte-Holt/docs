= Network security hardening

Network intrusions occur when unauthorized users gain access to network activity.
With this access, they can alter traffic and steal network resources.

// General questions
// What's the advice for where to put things in the cloud? Is this determined by the cloud or do you have to decide for yourself?

== Firewalls
Your production environment needs to run inside a firewall so your applications don't run in the demilitarized zone (DMZ).
The DMZ is an intermediary zone where proxy and web servers run that is located between public and private networking zones.
Typically, your network setup includes two firewalls, a perimeter firewall and a backend firewall.
The perimeter firewall exists between the public zone and the DMZ, and the backend firewall exists between the DMZ and the private zone.

== TLS connectivity
Open Liberty provides a simple TLS configuration with the link:/docs/ref/feature/#transportSecurity.html[Transport Security feature].
The Transport Security feature enables the link:/docs/ref/feature/#ssl.html[SSL feature] to support SSL connections and adds the ability to configure outbound transports.
TLS uses signed public keys to protect HTTP, IIOP, LDAP, MQ, JDBC, and messaging traffic between Open Liberty messaging engines, J2C, and SOAP traffic.
The default TLS config is simple and easy to configure, but it is not suitable for use in production because it generates a self-signed certificate.
The auto-generated certificate is convenient for development purposes, but certificates used in production should be signed by a trusted authority, such as Verisign.

With Open Liberty, proxies are configurable and no proxies are trusted by default.
For protection at the transport level when traffic comes in by proxy, make required Open Liberty servers accessible to only trusted proxies.
Disable non-TLS ports wherever possible.
Exposing only TLS-enabled ports requires careful consideration of the `server.xml` file because some features may automatically enable non-TLS ports.
Disable non-TLS ports by setting them to `-1`, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint" httpPort="-1" httpsPort="9445" />
----

=== Mutual authentication
Methods of authentication are configurable by application, meaning that applications running on the same server can use different means of authentication.
For example, if two applications are running on an Open Liberty server, one might use client authentication while the other uses basic authentication.
Open Liberty has two modes for client certificate authentication:

* *Supported*: The client might present a TLS certificate, but it is not required.
If the client presents an untrusted certificate, the certificate is ignored.
If the certificate is trusted, it can be used for application authentication.
* *Required*: The client must present a trusted TLS certificate.
If the certificate isn't sent or an untrusted certificate is sent, the connection is rejected.

For production environments, use mutual (2-way) TLS authentication whenever possible.
Mutual authentication is certificate-based authentication for clients.
If you use mutual authentication in conjunction with a proxy, consider using the link:/docs/ref/config/#httpDispatcher.html[`httpDispatcher`] parameter with the link:/docs/ref/config/#httpDispatcher.html#trustedHeaderOrigin[`trustedHeaderOrigin`] option.
This parameter ensures that only specified IP origins are permitted to authenticate:

[source,xml]
----
<httpDispatcher trustedHeaderOrigin=“10.20.30.40, 10.20.50.60” />
----

// What does setting these parameters do?
When you use mutual authentication and users log in directly to an Open Liberty server without a proxy, set the following parameters in the `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<webcontainer trusted=“false” /> or
<httpDispatcher trustedHeaderOrigin=“none” />
----

=== LDAP servers
Ensure that any links from the Open Liberty server to LDAP servers are secured by TLS.

The following snippet shows an example of how to enable TLS for an LDAP connection:

[source,xml]
----
<ssl id="ldapSSLConfig" keyStoreRef="ldapTrustStore" trustStoreRef="ldapTrustStore" /> // <1>

<keyStore id="ldapTrustStore" location="ldapTrustStore.jks" type="JKS"
  password="{xor}BQUFbm1sa2o=" />

<ldapRegistry id="MyLdap" realm="SampleLdapRealm"
  host="host.domain.com" port="636" ignoreCase="true" baseDN="o=domain,c=us"
  ldapType="OpenLDAP" idsFilters="myidsfilters"
  sslEnabled="true" // <2>
  sslRef="ldapSSLConfig" /> // <3>
----
<1> Sets the TLS `id`
<2> Enables TLS for the LDAP registry
<3> `sslRef` attribute references the TLS `id`

== LTPA best practices
Lightweight Third-Party Authentication (LTPA) is a single sign-on (SSO) technology that uses cookies or binary tokens for authentication.
For more information about how to use LTPA for SSO, see link:/docs/ref/general/#sso-config-ltpa.html[SSO configuration with LTPA cookies].

There are several measures that you can take to harden your network when you use LTPA with SSO.
By default, LTPA cookies are sent over HTTPS or HTTP connections.
For production purposes, the cookie that carries the LTPA token (`ltpaToken2`) must be protected.
If it's stolen, an intruder can act in place of the authenticated user until the token expires.
Cookies support the `secure` attribute, which tells the browser to send a cookie over HTTPS connections only.
Set the option in the `server.xml` file to require that LTPA cookies are sent over TLS connections:

[source,xml]
----
<webAppSecurity ssoRequiresSSL='true' />
----

// Why do you replace LTPA keys regularly?
Replace LTPA keys regularly.
To replace the keys, delete the `ltpa.keys` file and wait for the server to automatically regenerate them.
Then, copy the new keys file to the file systems for other servers that share the keys.

In production environments, the cookie for LTPA should be used only for HTTP requests and not for anything else, such as JavaScript applications.
The following example restricts the use of LTPA cookies to only HTTP connections:

// Does this include HTTPS?
[source,xml]
----
<webAppSecurity httpOnlyCookies='true' />
----

You can also use the `cookieHttpOnly` attribute to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
When set to `true`, this attribute specifies that session cookies must include the `HttpOnly` field.
Browsers that support the `HttpOnly` field don't allow client-side scripts to access cookies:

[source,xml]
----
<httpSession cookieHttpOnly='true' />
----

== Automated updates
Config updates must be carefully controlled in production environments to reduce the possibility that unknown changes or vulnerabilities are deployed to users.
By default, each server contains a monitored application directory named `dropins/configDropins`.
When an application is placed in this directory, the server automatically deploys and starts the application.
If you update config in the `server.xml` file or `configDropins` directory, the server automatically deploys the config changes.

To ensure that you deploy only explicitly configured applications, you can disable monitoring of the `dropins/configDropins` directory:

[source,xml]
----
<appliciationMonitor updateTrigger="mbean" dropinsEnabled="false" />
----

You can also disable automatic config updates by using the following config:

[source,xml]
----
<config updateTrigger="mbean" />
----

// Do we need this section? Was this supposed to be done by 2013? Would we still need transition mode information?
== SP 800-131a
You can set up Open Liberty to meet the SP 800-131a requirements that are defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
SP 800-131a strengthens security by defining stronger cryptographic keys and more robust algorithms.
This specification supports strict and transition modes.
The transition mode allows for a phased adoption of strict mode.

== Welcome page and headers
For production, you can disable Open Liberty's welcome page.
The welcome page is enabled by default, and accessing the `/` root context displays the Open Liberty homepage.
Disable this homepage by setting the `enableWelcomePage` custom property to `false` in the `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<httpDispatcher enableWelcomePage="false" />
----

// Why would you disable these headers?
Open Liberty server headers are also enabled by default.
Setting the `removeServerHeader` custom property to `true` removes server implementation information from HTTP headers:

[source,xml]
----
<httpOptions removeServerHeader="true" />
----

You can disable the _X-Powered-By_ header if you don't want to reveal which server is running.
Setting the `disableXPoweredBy` custom property to `true` disables the _X-Powered-By_ header, which prevents the header from being sent on the HTTP response:

[source,xml]
----
<webContainer disableXPoweredBy="true" />
----

== Session overflow
Restrict the number of sessions that can be created for applications that use in-memory sessions by disabling HTTP session overflow.
Restricting sessions can help prevent denial-of-service attacks in which attackers continually generate new sessions until all JVM memory is exhausted:

[source,xml]
----
<httpSession allowOverflow="false" maxInMemorySessionCount="1000" alwaysEncodeURL="true" cookieSecure="true" cookieHttpOnly="true" />
----

// Why must you secure this connector?
== JMX connector
You can secure access to the Open Liberty JMX connector for remote admin services in the web server plug-in by removing or commenting out the following entries:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- <Uri AffinityCookie="JSESSIONID" AffinityURLIdentifier="jsessionid" Name="/ibm/api/*" />
<Uri AffinityCookie="JSESSIONID" AffinityURLIdentifier="jsessionid" Name="/IBMJMXConnectorREST/*" /> -->
----
