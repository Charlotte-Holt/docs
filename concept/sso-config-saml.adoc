= SSO configuration with SAML Web Browser SSO

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an OASIS open standard that represents and exchanges user identity, authentication, and attribute information between the service provider (SP) and identity provider (IdP). The SP relies on assertions that are issued by the IdP to authenticate a user.

SAML provides the flexibility to configure multiple scenarios, such as Web browser single-sign on (SSO), which is the most common scenario. The Web browser SSO is commonly used with the Single Logout profile and SAML metadata.

== Web browser SSO profile

SAML specifies a Web browser SSO profile that involves an IdP, an SP, and a principal that contains an HTTP user agent.

The Web browser SSO profile is typically used with a list of bindings that describe message transmission protocols. Each of the involved parties can choose its own binding. For example, the SP uses the HTTP Redirect binding to send an authentication request while the IdP uses the HTTP POST binding to transmit the authentication response. One of most common bindings, as shown in the following example, is that both SP and IdP use HTTP post bindings:

=== SP-Initiated SSO and IdP-initiated SSO

The SAML web browser authentication flow consists of two possible scenarios. With the SP-intiated authentication flow, a user starts at the service provider for a request to a secured web application. The IdP-initiated flow consists of a user that authenticates to the IdP that redirects the user to the SP with a SAML response message.

== Single Logout Profile

Single Logout (SLO) is a near-simultaneous logout of a user from a specific authentication session and all active SP sessions that are associated with the authentication session. SLO can be initiated by both the SP and the IdP.

=== SP-initated SLO

With the SP-initiated SLO, a user clicks a logout link in the SP to start a global logout. The logout request is fulfilled with the following process:

1. The SP sends a logout request to the SAML through a web browser.
2. The IdP requests all active SP sessions to log out.
3. The IdP logs out the user and sends the response back to the log out request of the SP.
4. The SP ends the user's local security session.

=== IdP-initiated SLO

With the IdP-initiated SLO, the user clicks a logout link in the IdP to start a global logout. The logout request is fulfilled with the following process:

1. The IdP sends a logout request to every SP that shares a login session through a web browser.
2. The SP ends the local user login session.
3. The IdP ends the user's IdP login session.

== SAML metadata

SAML metadata is configuration data that is required to automatically negotiate agreements between the SP and the IdP. The metadata consists of identifiers, binding support and endpoints, certificates, keys, cryptographic capabilities, and security and privacy policies.

== Open Liberty and SAML

Open Liberty supports the SAML Web browser SSO profile with HTTP post binding, Single Logout, and SAML metadata.
