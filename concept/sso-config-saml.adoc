= SSO configuration with SAML Web Browser SSO and Web inbound propagation

SAML Web Browser Single-Sign-On (SSO) enables web applications to delegate user authentication to a SAML identity provider instead of a configured user registry.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an OASIS open standard for representing and exchanging user identity, authentication, and attribute information. A SAML assertion is an XML formatted token that is used to transfer user identity and attribute information from the identity provider of a user to a trusted service provider as part of the completion of a single sign-on request. A SAML assertion provides a vendor neutral means of transferring information between federation business partners. By using SAML, an enterprise service provider can contact a separate enterprise identity provider to authenticate users who are trying to access secure content.

The server supports the SAML web browser single sign-on profile with HTTP Post bindings, and acts as a SAML service provider. A web user authenticates to a SAML identity provider, which produces a SAML assertion, and the SAML service provider uses the SAML assertion to establish a security context for the web user. The SAML web SSO flow includes three components:

* The end user
* The identity provider (IdP)
* The service provider (SP)

The user always authenticates to the IdP, and the SP relies on IdP assertion to identify the user as shown in the following example:

== SAML Web Browser SSO Scenarios

=== SP-initiated solicited Web SSO
In the following scenario, a user attempts to access a protected resource directly on an SP Web site without being logged on. The user does not have an account on the SP site, but does have a federated account managed by a third-party IdP. The SP sends an authentication request to the IdP. Both the request and the returned SAML assertion are sent through the userâ€™s browser where the user request is verified.

=== IdP-Initiated unsolicited Web SSO
In the following scenario, a user is logged on to the IdP and attempts to access a resource on a remote SP server. The SAML assertion is transported to the SP where it is verified.
